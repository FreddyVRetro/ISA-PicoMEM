 *  \brief USB Human Interface Device (HID) Class report descriptor parser.
 *
 *  \section Sec_HIDParser_Dependencies Module Source Dependencies
 *  The following files must be built with any user project that uses this module:
 *	- LUFA/Drivers/USB/Class/Host/HIDParser.c <i>(Makefile source module name: LUFA_SRC_USB)</i>
 *
 *  \section Sec_HIDParser_ModDescription Module Description
 *  Human Interface Device (HID) class report descriptor parser. This module implements a parser than is
 *  capable of processing a complete HID report descriptor, and outputting a flat structure containing the
 *  contents of the report in an a more friendly format. The parsed data may then be further processed and used
 *  within an application to process sent and received HID reports to and from an attached HID device.
 *
 *  A HID report descriptor consists of a set of HID report items, which describe the function and layout
 *  of data exchanged between a HID device and a host, including both the physical encoding of each item
 *  (such as a button, key press or joystick axis) in the sent and received data packets - known as "reports" -
 *  as well as other information about each item such as the usages, data range, physical location and other
 *  characteristics. In this way a HID device can retain a high degree of flexibility in its capabilities, as it
 *  is not forced to comply with a given report layout or feature-set.
 *
 *  This module also contains routines for the processing of data in an actual HID report, using the parsed report
 *  descriptor data as a guide for the encoding.
